Tell us about your open life science project!


Your project doesn’t have to be technical — it can be a curriculum (open educational resource), an open data project or report, an open source software project, open publication, community/team culture movements, or anything else that:


1. supports openness in life science. 
2. has something to work on (a feature, module, or minimum viable product) during the program
3. allows and welcomes contributions by others


Whether your project is just an idea at this stage or something that’s been running for years, all applications are welcome.
